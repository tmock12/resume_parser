# ResumeParser

WIP - DO NOT USE!

Resume parsers are crazy expensive and for a good reason, its not easy. This was me playing around with parsing different formatted resumes to extract a limited dataset. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'resume_parser'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:
